## Usage

URL: https://drrobotnik7.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/

When a user opens the planner the current day and date is displayed at the top of the calendar.

The user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. 

Any time in the past is colour coded as grey. The current hour is red. Future hours are green.

When users click on a timeblock they can enter an event. The event can be saved by clicking on the save button on the right of the timeblock.

Events persist even after the page is refreshed.
