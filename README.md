## Usage

When a user opens the planner the current day and date is displayed at the top of the calendar.

The user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. These can be amended in the script.js file by changing the minHour and maxHour values on lines 8 and 9 respectively.

Any time in the past is colour coded as grey. The current hour is red. Future hours are green.

When users click on a timeblock they can type in an event. The event can be saved by clicking on the save button on the right of the timeblock, a tooltip will temporarily appear at the top right to let the user know the data was successful saved.

Events persist even after the page is refreshed.
